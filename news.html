		<b>Chunk loading added</b><br>
		Chunks have been added. These are now loaded or unloaded depending on the player's position. These are loaded later from a chunkdata.dat or chunkdata.py file.<br>

		Next steps:<br>
		- Load chunks from the file<br>
		- Add player

		<b>First Elements and Features added</b><br>
		The first new features have been added. You can now enter the world of GoD directly when you start the game instead of going to<br>
		the level selection screen. There you can open and close the menu with the ESC key. In the menu you can choose between: Continue game,<br>
		Settings and Save and Exit. There are chunks in the world and various elements in the chunks, such as walls, buttons, chests,<br>
		collectables and much more.<br><br>
		Next steps: loading the chunks in a certain range, adding the player and running the player.

		<b>First few steps done</b><br>
		The first steps have been taken. The level system has been removed and with it the maps, the duengons, the villages, the trading system and<br>
		the sales system, as well as talking to villagers. However, this is not as bad as it sounds, because everything was not well developed,<br>
		sometimes didn't work at all and had a lot of bugs. The update 0.20.0 will be the biggest update, so far...

		<b>Version 0.20.0 will be released later...</b><br>
		Version 0.20.0 will be released later than planned. I have been very busy recently and was therefore unable to develop the update in time.<br><br> 
		Therefore, the update will probably be released on 30 July 2025, the 2nd birthday of the game. However, this date is only a wish because there are still<br>
		a lot of missing features and there are still a lot of bugs.<br><br>
		The main feature is the creation of a map, or parts of a map. UI updates in the main menu are also possible.<br><br>
		If possible, I will keep you up to date here in the news. To see which features are still to be implemented or have been implemented you can have a look at<br>
		the <a href="backlog.html" style="color: #1d1d1d;">backlog</a> and if you want to have a look at older updates and their features you can have a look at the <a href="changelog.html" style="color: #1d1d1d;">changelog</a>...

		<b>Version 0.20.0 will be released on 01 February 2025!</b><br>
		The update is coming later than planned. Running and buttons, pressure plates, chests, walls, trees and leaves have already been added. You can also interact<br>
		with certain objects. However, there are still a lot of bugs with the event handling, there are still no enemies and the ui of the inventory is to be completely<br>
		reworked. For these reasons, version 0.20.0 will not be released until the beginning of February.
